DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA SCIENCE USING PYTHON TASK- 3  
Task 3: Clustering Analysis– Customer Segmentation  

Objective: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to target each segment effectively.  

Project Steps:  
Step 1: Dataset Selection  
● Dataset Name: customer_data.csv  
● Columns:  
   ○ CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.  
   ○ Age:Age of the customer.  
   ○ Annual Income: Income in $ (or any currency).  
   ○ Spending Score: A score assigned to customers based on their spending patterns and behavior.  
Step 2: Tasks to Perform  
1. Load the Dataset  
    ● Use libraries such as Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.  
    ● Inspect the dataset by checking:  
      ○ Shape, missing values, duplicates, and data types.  
      ○ Summary statistics to understand ranges of values.  
2. Data Preprocessing  
   ● Standardize the data:  
   ○ Use a scaler (e.g., StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler from sklearn) to ensure all features are on the same scale.  
   ○ This step is crucial since clustering algorithms are sensitive to feature magnitudes.  
3. Clustering  
 ● Determine the optimal number of clusters:  
 ○ Use the Elbow Method:  
  ■ Plot the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.  
  ■ The"elbow point" indicates the optimal number of clusters.  
 ○ Alternatively, use the Silhouette Score for evaluation.  
 ● Apply K-Means Clustering:  
 ○ Use the optimal number of clusters identified from the Elbow Method.  
 ○ Assign a cluster label to each customer.  
4. Visualization  
 ● Create visualizations to represent the clusters:  
 ○ 2D Scatter Plot:  
 ■ Use PCA(Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE to reduce dimensions to two for visualization.  
 ■ Plot clusters in different colors.  
 ○ Pair Plots: Visualize relationships between features within clusters.  
 ○ Centroid Visuals: Show the centroid of each cluster for better interpretation.  

Deliverables:  
 1. Clustered Dataset:  
 ○ Add a new column to the dataset with the assigned cluster labels for each customer.  
 2. Visualizations:  
 ○ A 2D scatter plot representing customer clusters.  
 ○ Elbow Method plot showing the optimal number of clusters.  
 ○ Any additional visuals (e.g., pair plots, heatmaps).  
 3. Recommendations:  
 ○ Insights and actions based on clusters:  
 ■ Which groups to target for promotions or premium products.  
 ■ Identify high-spending customers and propose loyalty programs.  
 ■ Tailored marketing strategies for different age or income segments.
